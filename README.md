# Sales Performance Analysis - Rakamin x Bank Muamalat Project Based Internship
This project was completed as part of the Virtual Internship Experience Program in collaboration with Bank Muamalat, using a simulated business case of PT Sejahtera Bersama.

PT Sejahtera Bersama manages sales data across multiple tables, including customers, products, product categories, and transactions. However, the lack of an integrated data view makes it difficult to monitor sales performance and extract meaningful insights for decision making.

As a Business Intelligence Analyst, the goal of this project is to consolidate transactional data into a single master dataset, analyze sales performance across key dimensions, and deliver insights through an interactive dashboard. The analysis aims to help management better understand sales trends, identify high-performing products and regions, and support data-driven business decisions.
